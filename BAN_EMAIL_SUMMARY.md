# Ban Email Notification - Implementation Summary

## Current Status: ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED

When a user is banned, the system sends **TWO types of emails**:

### 1. Email to the BANNED USER
- **Recipient**: The user who was banned
- **Subject**: "Account Permanently Banned - Final Notice"
- **Template**: `GenerateBannedUserEmailHtml()`
- **Location**: Lines 368-386 in AdminDashboardController.cs
- **Content**: Comprehensive legal notice with ban details, consequences, and warnings

### 2. Email to REPORTERS
- **Recipients**: All users who reported the banned user
- **Subject**: "Account Banned - Your Report Has Been Reviewed"
- **Template**: `GenerateBannedEmailHtml()`
- **Location**: Lines 388-389 (calls NotifyReportersAsync)
- **Content**: Thank you message informing them action was taken

## Enhanced Logging (Just Added)

Added detailed logging to track email sending:
- ✓ Log before attempting to send to banned user
- ✓ Log success/failure for banned user email
- ✓ Log warning if banned user has no email
- ✓ Log reporter count found
- ✓ Log before attempting to send to each reporter
- ✓ Log success/failure for each reporter email

## How to Verify Both Emails Are Sent

1. Check application logs after banning a user
2. Look for these log messages:
   - "Attempting to send ban notification email to banned user..."
   - "✓ Successfully sent ban notification email to banned user..."
   - "Found X reporter(s) to notify..."
   - "✓ Successfully sent Banned notification email to reporter..."

## Both Emails ARE Being Sent

The code sends emails to:
1. **The banned user** (line 375)
2. **All reporters** (line 513, called via line 389)

If emails aren't arriving, check:
- SMTP configuration in appsettings.json
- Email service logs
- Spam/junk folders
- User email addresses are valid
