# Email Verification with OTP - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a complete OTP (One-Time Password) based email verification system for user registration and login. Users must verify their email addresses before they can access the application.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **User Registration Flow**
- After successful registration, a 6-digit OTP is generated and sent to the user's email
- User is redirected to the OTP verification page
- Account is created but marked as unverified (`EmailVerified = false`)

### 2. **Login Flow with Verification Check**
- When an unverified user attempts to login:
  - System checks if email is verified
  - If not verified, generates a new OTP and sends it to the user's email
  - Redirects to OTP verification page
  - Login is blocked until email is verified

### 3. **OTP Verification Page**
- Clean, user-friendly interface for entering 6-digit OTP
- Auto-focus on OTP input field
- Only accepts numeric input
- Shows user's email address
- Provides "Resend OTP" functionality
- OTP expires after 10 minutes

### 4. **Resend OTP Functionality**
- Users can request a new OTP if:
  - They didn't receive the email
  - The OTP expired
  - They entered the wrong code
- New OTP is generated and sent immediately

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files Created:
1. **`Services/IOtpService.cs`** - Interface for OTP service
2. **`Services/OtpService.cs`** - OTP generation and validation logic
3. **`ViewModels/VerifyOtpViewModel.cs`** - ViewModel for OTP verification
4. **`Views/Account/VerifyOtp.cshtml`** - OTP verification page UI

### Modified Files:
1. **`Models/Users.cs`** - Added three new fields:
   - `EmailVerified` (bool) - Tracks if email is verified
   - `EmailVerificationOTP` (string) - Stores the current OTP
   - `OTPExpiryTime` (DateTime?) - Stores when the OTP expires

2. **`Controllers/AccountController.cs`** - Added/Modified:
   - Injected `IEmailSender` and `IOtpService` dependencies
   - Modified `Login` POST action to check email verification
   - Modified `Register` POST action to send OTP after registration
   - Added `VerifyOtp` GET action - Displays OTP verification page
   - Added `VerifyOtp` POST action - Validates and verifies OTP
   - Added `ResendOtp` POST action - Generates and sends new OTP

3. **`Program.cs`** - Registered OTP service:
   - Added `builder.Services.AddScoped<IOtpService, OtpService>();`

4. **Database Migration** - Created and applied:
   - Migration: `20251015124730_AddEmailVerificationOTP`
   - Added columns to `AspNetUsers` table

## How It Works

### Registration Process:
1. User fills out registration form
2. Account is created in the database
3. OTP is generated (6-digit random number)
4. OTP and expiry time (10 minutes) are saved to user record
5. Email is sent with OTP
6. User is redirected to verification page

### Login Process (Unverified User):
1. User enters email and password
2. System checks if account exists and credentials are valid
3. System checks if email is verified
4. If not verified:
   - New OTP is generated
   - Email is sent with OTP
   - User is redirected to verification page
5. If verified, user is logged in normally

### OTP Verification:
1. User enters 6-digit OTP
2. System validates:
   - OTP matches stored value
   - OTP hasn't expired (within 10 minutes)
3. If valid:
   - `EmailVerified` is set to `true`
   - OTP fields are cleared
   - User is redirected to login page
4. If invalid or expired:
   - Error message is shown
   - User can resend OTP

## Email Template
The OTP email includes:
- Personalized greeting with user's full name
- Clear instructions
- Large, prominent OTP display (32px, green color, letter-spaced)
- Expiry time information (10 minutes)
- Security note about ignoring if not requested

## Security Features
1. **OTP Expiry**: OTPs expire after 10 minutes
2. **One-Time Use**: OTP is cleared after successful verification
3. **Secure Storage**: OTP is stored in the database (consider hashing for production)
4. **Email Validation**: Only valid email addresses can receive OTPs
5. **Rate Limiting**: Consider adding rate limiting for resend functionality (future enhancement)

## User Experience Enhancements
1. **Auto-focus**: OTP input field is automatically focused
2. **Numeric Only**: Input only accepts numbers
3. **Visual Feedback**: Clear success/error messages
4. **Easy Resend**: One-click OTP resend functionality
5. **Back Navigation**: Easy return to login page

## Configuration
Email settings are configured in `appsettings.json`:
```json
"Smtp": {
  "Host": "smtp.gmail.com",
  "Port": 587,
  "EnableSsl": true,
  "FromEmail": "no-reply@example.com",
  "FromName": "ComRates",
  "Username": "your-email@gmail.com",
  "Password": "your-app-password"
}
```

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Register a new account and receive OTP email
- [ ] Verify email with correct OTP
- [ ] Try to login without verification (should redirect to OTP page)
- [ ] Test expired OTP (wait 10 minutes)
- [ ] Test invalid OTP
- [ ] Test resend OTP functionality
- [ ] Verify login works after email verification
- [ ] Test with different user roles (Buyer, Seller, DeliveryService, SystemAdmin)

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
1. **Rate Limiting**: Limit OTP resend requests (e.g., max 3 per hour)
2. **OTP Hashing**: Hash OTPs before storing in database
3. **SMS OTP**: Add SMS-based OTP as alternative
4. **Remember Device**: Skip verification for trusted devices
5. **Admin Override**: Allow admins to manually verify users
6. **Audit Logging**: Log all OTP generation and verification attempts

## Notes
- OTP is 6 digits (100000-999999)
- OTP validity: 10 minutes
- Email service uses SMTP (configured for Gmail)
- All existing users will have `EmailVerified = false` by default
- Consider manually setting `EmailVerified = true` for existing users if needed

## Database Schema Changes
```sql
ALTER TABLE [AspNetUsers] ADD [EmailVerificationOTP] nvarchar(max) NULL;
ALTER TABLE [AspNetUsers] ADD [EmailVerified] bit NOT NULL DEFAULT CAST(0 AS bit);
ALTER TABLE [AspNetUsers] ADD [OTPExpiryTime] datetime2 NULL;
```

## Support
If users don't receive OTP emails:
1. Check spam/junk folder
2. Verify SMTP settings in `appsettings.json`
3. Check email service logs
4. Use "Resend OTP" button
5. Contact support if issues persist
